# [Accessible Step](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessible-step)

Walk up full-height blocks without reaching for the jump button.

This mod requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), so make sure it's installed with this mod.

This mod adds a new "Step Assistance" option into the Accessibility and Controls screens, replacing the Auto-jump option.

The option can be cycled between three values:

1. Off, where no assistance is given.
2. Step, where the player's step height is increased to cover full blocks.
3. Auto-jump, where Minecraft's built-in auto-jump is used.

## Does this work on Multiplayer?

Yes, this mod works on multiplayer. This mod does not have to be installed on the server.

**But**, you might want to be careful. While this mod is meant as an accessibility tool, some servers (especially competitive ones) will likely classify this mod as cheating. To be safe, _turn off step assistance while playing on competitive servers_.

## Why yet another stepping-up-blocks mod?

Mostly, it's because I'm learning to mod and small projects like these are good ways to learn new parts of the game's code.

But also I've wanted to maintain a small set of mods that I commonly use so I can update them whenever I like. I've since over-engineered some automation to update things automatically, so I'm more confident that I can actually maintain these mods over a longer term.
