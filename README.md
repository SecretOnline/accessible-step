# Accessible Step

Walk up full-height blocks without having to press jump!

This mod requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), so make sure it's installed with this mod.

## Multiplayer?

Yes, this mod works on multiplayer.

**But**, you might want to be careful. While this mod is meant as an accessibility tool, some servers (especially competitive ones) will likely classify this mod as cheating. To be safe, _disable this mod while playing on competitive servers_.

## Why yet another step up mod?

Mostly, I'm learning to mod, and so small projects like these are good ways to learn new pieces.

But also I've wanted to maintain a small set of mods that I commonly use so I can update them whenever I like. So, I've done what I do best and over-engineered some automation to update mods for me.

## Forge?

No.
